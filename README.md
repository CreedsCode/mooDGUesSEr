# does not work anymore! 

I destroyed like everything with my last copy pasted git commit, just looked forward to get it quick up. (-2 Hours, till my sleep rhythm breaks.)


It was a little afternoon project. That I wanted to get done after some ML learning.

## Todo:
- Improve dataset
- Get it up and running again.

Where do I put that up?
